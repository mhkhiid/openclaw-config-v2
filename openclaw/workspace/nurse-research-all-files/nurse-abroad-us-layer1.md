## 1. EB-3 Schedule A 完整政策

### 1.1 USCIS 官方页面

**[官方链接]** https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-third-preference-eb-3

**[原文摘录]**
> "Third preference petitions are usually accompanied by an signed Form ETA-9089, Application for Permanent Employment Certification, approved by DOL, or, for labor certification applications filed on or after June 1, 2023, using DOL's Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system, an approved and signed Form ETA-9089, Final Determination – Permanent Employment Certification Approval (Final Certification)."

> "Petitions for Schedule A occupations are not required to have a DOL-approved labor certification. This is because DOL has already determined there are not sufficient U.S. workers for those occupations. Currently, DOL has designated 2 groups of occupations under Schedule A. Group I includes professional nurses and physical therapists. Group II includes beneficiaries with exceptional ability in the sciences or arts (including college and university teachers) and immigrants of exceptional ability in the performing arts."

**[中文解读]**
- EB-3 职业移民通常需要劳工部批准的劳工证(ETA-9089表格)
- **Schedule A 职业可免除劳工证要求**，因为劳工部已预先认定这些职业美国工人不足
- **Schedule A Group I 包括：专业护士(Professional Nurses)和物理治疗师**
- Schedule A Group II 包括：科学或艺术领域的杰出能力人才

### 1.2 Schedule A Group I 护士条款原文 (USCIS Policy Manual)

**[官方链接]** https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-e-chapter-7

**[原文摘录 - Schedule A 职业定义]**
> "The following occupations comprise Schedule A:
> - Group I – physical therapists and professional nurses; and
> - Group II – immigrants of exceptional ability in the sciences or arts, including college and university teachers, and immigrants of exceptional ability in the performing arts."

**[原文摘录 - 专业护士定义]**
> "A professional nurse is a person who applies the art and science of nursing which reflects comprehension of principles derived from the physical, biological, and behavioral sciences. Professional nursing generally includes making clinical judgments involving the observation, care and counsel of persons requiring nursing care; administering of medicines and treatments prescribed by the physician or dentist; and participation in the activities for the promotion of health and prevention of illness in others.
>
> A program of study for professional nurses generally includes theory and practice in clinical areas such as obstetrics, surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, and medicine."

**[原文摘录 - 护士资格要求]**
> "For Group I, registered nurse occupations, the employer must submit evidence to establish that the beneficiary currently has (and had at the time of filing):
> - A full, unrestricted permanent license to practice nursing in the state of intended employment; OR
> - A certificate from TruMerit (formerly the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools or CGFNS) or an equivalent credentialing organization; OR
> - Evidence that the beneficiary has passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) as of the date of filing."

**[中文解读]**
- **专业护士**指运用护理艺术与科学，涵盖观察、护理、给药、健康促进等活动
- 护士教育通常包括产科、外科、儿科、精神科和内科的理论与实践
- **三选一满足以下条件**：
  1. 持有执业州的全资格、无限制永久护士执照；或
  2. 持有CGFNS(现TruMerit)证书或同等认证机构证书；或
  3. 通过NCLEX-RN考试

### 1.3 免劳工证程序具体说明

**[原文摘录]**
> "For these two types of cases, the U.S. employer submits an uncertified application for permanent labor certification to USCIS at the time of filing the Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers (Form I-140), and USCIS reviews the application for permanent labor certification during the adjudication of the petition."

> "Because of the occupational shortage of these U.S. workers, DOL has 'pre-certified' Schedule A occupations. This means that an employer who wishes to hire a person for a Schedule A occupation is not required to conduct a test of the labor market and apply for a permanent labor certification with DOL. Rather, this employer must apply for Schedule A designation by submitting an application for permanent labor certification to USCIS in conjunction with the petition."

**[中文解读]**
- **免劳工证的核心逻辑**：劳工部已预先认证(Pre-certified)Schedule A职业，确认美国工人不足
- **雇主无需**：进行劳动力市场测试、向劳工部申请劳工证
- **雇主必须**：在递交I-140申请时，同时提交未认证的劳工证申请(ETA-9089)
- USCIS在审理I-140时一并审查劳工证申请

---

### 1.4 I-140 申请要求 (Schedule A)

**[原文摘录]**
> "In order to apply for Schedule A designation for petitions filed on or after March 28, 2005, the petitioning employer must complete and submit:
> - A properly filed Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers (Form I-140), with appropriate filing fees;
> - An uncertified Application for Permanent Employment Certification (ETA Form 9089), with the employer and beneficiary's original signatures;
> - A prevailing wage determination issued by DOL's NPWC, in which the validity period is not less than 90 days or more than 1 year from the determination date;
> - A copy of the notice sent to an appropriate collective bargaining unit, if applicable, or a copy of the notice posted at the facility documenting posting for at least 10 consecutive business days and within the period between 30 and 180 days before the employer filed the petition;
> - Copies of all in-house media, whether electronic or printed;
> - Evidence that the beneficiary meets the specific DOL requirements for Schedule A designation;
> - All other documentation required to show eligibility for the employment-based immigrant visa classification sought."

**[中文解读]**
- **I-140表格**： immigrant petition for alien workers
- **ETA-9089表格**：未认证的永久劳工证申请（雇主和受益人原签名）
- **现行工资决定**(Prevailing Wage Determination)：由劳工部NPWC签发，有效期90天至1年
- **通知要求**：
  - 如有工会，向工会代表发送通知；或
  - 在工作场所张贴通知至少10个连续工作日
  - 张贴时间必须在递交申请前30至180天之间
- **内部媒体公告**：电子或印刷形式的内部招聘公告
- **受益人资格证明**：证明符合Schedule A指定要求

---

### 1.5 现行工资和通知要求详情

**[原文摘录 - 现行工资要求]**
> "An employer must obtain a valid prevailing wage determination from DOL's National Prevailing Wage Center (NPWC) before it can file the petition with USCIS. The prevailing wage determination ensures that the wages offered to the beneficiary are reflective of the wages offered for comparable positions at the location where the job offer exists before the petitioner files the petition.
>
> The wage offered to the beneficiary must be no less than 100 percent of the prevailing wage."

**[原文摘录 - 通知张贴要求]**
> "Before an employer can file a petition, it must have also provided a notice of the position(s) it is seeking to fill under Schedule A, Group I or II, to the employer's bargaining representative. Alternatively, if there is no such representative, then the employer must provide notice to its employees. Such notice must be posted for at least 10 consecutive business days in a clearly visible location at the facility or location of employment.
>
> The notice must have been posted between 30 days and 180 days before the employer filed the petition."

**[中文解读]**
- **现行工资**：必须通过劳工部NPWC获取，工资不得低于现行工资的100%
- **通知期**：申请前30至180天之间
- **张贴期**：至少10个连续工作日
